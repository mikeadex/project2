# Meet Ella, an HR Expert - Project 2

![CV Writer Video](<cv writer-1.gif>)

## Overview

Ella is the second iteration of my CV-building and job-market-oriented application project. This project builds on the foundations laid in Project 1, transforming it into a more sophisticated platform that not only helps users create compelling CVs but also provides insights into their skill sets and how they align with various job roles.

The application's core idea originated from real-world concerns expressed by both job seekers and employers—while many applicants boast beautifully formatted CVs, they often lack the tangible skill sets that organizations need. With Ella, the aim is to bridge the gap between candidate presentation and employer expectations, ultimately creating a tool that benefits both parties.

This README will guide you through the project's backstory, features, structure, prerequisites, installation steps, usage instructions, dependencies, configuration options, and contribution guidelines. It concludes with licensing information, acknowledgments, and future improvement plans, including a migration to more robust frameworks.

## Backstory

_(Written on 18/12/2024)_

This project's inception can be traced back to a radio show on LBC in the UK, where presenters and callers discussed the challenges of the modern job market. Employers expressed frustration about candidates who appeared well-qualified on paper but did not possess the real-world skills necessary for the positions they were applying to. Meanwhile, job seekers lamented being underemployed or struggling to secure any role despite having formal qualifications.

This disparity between form and substance in the hiring landscape raised several questions:

- Why do beautifully formatted CVs fail to secure interviews or offers?
- How can job seekers align their skill sets more closely with job requirements?
- Is there a systematic way to provide feedback on both CV presentation and skill relevance?

Inspired by these debates, Project 1 set out to create a CV Builder that helps job seekers present their qualifications effectively. With Project 2—Ella, an HR Expert— aim to take this further. Ella is designed to not only assist in crafting the CV but also to analyze and enhance it using AI-driven insights. Over time, I will incorporate machine learning libraries, integrated front-end improvements, and orchestrated a more holistic solution.

## Features

### 1. Document Upload and Processing

Users can upload their existing CVs in Word format (for now but will accommodate pdf format when project is ready). The system uses libraries like mammoth to extract text from .docx files and feed it into an AI model (such as Google's Generative AI, currently used for testing) for rewriting, refining, or restructuring, thus enhancing the CV's clarity and impact.

### 2. CV/Resume Analysis and Enhancement

The platform doesn't just format the CV; it evaluates its content. Drawing on skill evaluation algorithms and integrated AI, Ella recommends improvements, suggests keywords, and aligns the candidate's experience with industry standards. It identifies gaps in skill sets and provides advice on what training or qualifications might help bridge these gaps.

### 3. Interactive User Interface

Gone are the days of long, monotonous forms. With Ella, users enjoy a multi-step form that breaks down CV-building tasks into manageable pieces. Real-time field validation ensures accuracy. The user experience (UX) is front and center, making the process intuitive and friendly.

### 4. Local and Cloud Data Storage

Ella leverages local storage to maintain form data temporarily for a smooth user experience, allowing users to pick up where they left off without losing progress. For registered users, data moves to a database for persistent storage, enabling long-term record-keeping, version control, and easy future updates.

### 5. AI-Powered Skill Evaluation

This feature examines the user's chosen job role against their current skill set, highlighting mismatches and areas of improvement. It provides actionable insights, helping job seekers target the right positions and upskill where necessary.

### 6. LinkedIn Integration (Planned)

Future versions will facilitate integration with LinkedIn profiles, pulling in relevant experience details and endorsements to further refine CV suggestions and skill matching.
