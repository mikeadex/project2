## Journey Overview

Welcome to the documentation of my fullstack development journey at Code Institute and WAES London’s Frontend Bootcamp. My goal is to enhance my expertise in fullstack web development, equipping myself with the knowledge and skills necessary to build scalable and efficient applications.

Throughout this journey, I will be learning and implementing technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django, and working with databases to create dynamic and responsive web solutions.

## Learning Path

Here’s a breakdown of the technologies I am learning and how each plays a role in my journey:

    •	HTML: Mastering the foundational language of the web, I have learned how to structure and present content effectively using semantic HTML elements.
    •	CSS: CSS has empowered me to style and design web pages, ensuring they are not only functional but also visually appealing. From flexbox to grid systems, I’ve worked to create responsive and interactive designs.
    •	JavaScript: Moving into JavaScript, I will be diving deep into programming logic, DOM manipulation, and dynamic user interactions that make web applications functional and engaging.
    •	Python: As a high-level programming language, Python will enable me to handle backend operations and server-side development, forming the core logic of my applications.
    •	Django: Django, a powerful Python framework, will allow me to manage complex database interactions and build robust fullstack applications with ease.
    •	Databases: My learning will cover both SQL and NoSQL databases, giving me the ability to manage data, store information securely, and ensure scalability.

## First Project: Frontend Framework of My CV Builder Solution

One of my first milestones in this journey was completing my first project, a CV Builder Solution. This project focuses on creating a user-friendly frontend for an AI-powered resume builder. The objective is to offer a tool that assists users in creating compelling resumes through various options: importing from LinkedIn, allowing users to input their details manually, or uploading an existing CV for enhancement.

    •	Project Link: CV Builder Solution
    •	Tech Stack: HTML, CSS
    •	Objective: Build a responsive, interactive, and accessible interface for users to create their resumes.

The project serves as a testament to my learning in HTML and CSS, focusing on clean code practices, semantic structure, and responsive design principles. I’ve created an intuitive layout that ensures users can navigate through the CV builder process seamlessly on any device.

## Skills Acquired and Reflections

So far, my journey has been both challenging and rewarding. Here are some key takeaways from my learning so far:

    •	HTML & CSS Mastery: I have honed my skills in designing and structuring web pages with clean, maintainable code. I’ve also explored best practices for ensuring accessibility and responsiveness across different devices.
    •	Building Real-World Solutions: The CV Builder project is a real-world application of what I’ve learned, which has shown me the importance of combining functionality with design. This experience has also emphasized the value of attention to detail, especially in responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.
    •	Self-Discipline: Managing my learning between bootcamps and personal projects has taught me how to stay disciplined, continuously push boundaries, and explore new topics.

## Next Steps in My Journey

As I continue with my learning, here are the milestones I aim to achieve next:

    1.	JavaScript Proficiency: Understanding how to build dynamic and interactive web applications through JavaScript.
    2.	Backend Development with Python & Django: Integrating backend logic into my projects, starting with Python and progressing into Django to build fullstack applications.
    3.	Database Integration: Learning how to manage data using relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases and integrating these into my applications.
    4.	Fullstack Application: Building my first fullstack web application using the combined knowledge of frontend and backend development.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

Like any journey, there have been challenges along the way. Some of these include:

    •	Responsive Design: Ensuring that every web page works seamlessly across all devices was one of the most significant challenges in the initial stages. Through trial and error, I’ve learned to leverage CSS grid and flexbox effectively.
    •	Time Management: Balancing coursework, projects, and personal study has required careful planning and prioritization, a skill I am continuously refining.

## Looking Forward

I’m excited about the road ahead as I delve into more complex technologies like JavaScript and Django, and as I work on more projects to enhance my portfolio. My goal is to continue growing as a fullstack developer, eventually building complete applications from frontend to backend.

This journey is only just beginning, and I am thrilled to keep pushing boundaries, solving problems, and creating impactful solutions through code.

This README.md serves as a reflection of my journey and progress as I advance in my learning and build meaningful projects and i promise to update this as the project progresses. Thank you for following along!
